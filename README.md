## Install

Run from your project root — auto-detects your agent:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiahongc/credit-card-skills/main/install.sh)
```

<details>
<summary>Target a specific agent</summary>

```bash
# Claude Code only  → .claude/skills/
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiahongc/credit-card-skills/main/install.sh) --claude

# OpenAI Codex only → .agents/skills/
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiahongc/credit-card-skills/main/install.sh) --codex

# Both
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiahongc/credit-card-skills/main/install.sh) --all
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code plugin (no install needed)</summary>

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/credit-card-skills
```

Skills load with a namespace: `/credit-card-skills:card-full`, etc.

## Setup (Optional)

For faster search results, set a [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your BRAVE_API_KEY
```

Free tier gives 2,000 queries/month. Without it, commands fall back to built-in web search (slower).

## How It Works

- **Issuer-first**: always checks the card's official product page before secondary sources
- **Fast**: uses Brave Search API for ~1s lookups instead of slow page fetches; knowledge-first commands answer in seconds
- **Deep**: search-required commands pull up to 5 secondary sources; knowledge-first commands use 1 secondary for cross-checks
- **Compact**: emoji section headings, numbered lists, no prose padding
- **Honest**: unresolved fields are flagged in confidence notes, never invented
- **6 curated sources**: NerdWallet, The Points Guy, Doctor of Credit, Bankrate, One Mile at a Time, Upgraded Points (see [`source-policy.yaml`](.claude/skills/card-shared/source-policy.yaml))

---

## Compatibility

Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard — one `SKILL.md` format, works across agents.

| Agent | Skill path |
|-------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| OpenAI Codex | `.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/` |
| ClawHub | [`clawhub/`](clawhub/) (self-contained, ready to publish) |
| Others | see [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) |

---

## Shared Layer

All commands share a single research policy and output contracts:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`source-policy.yaml`](.claude/skills/card-shared/source-policy.yaml) | Approved sources, issuer domains, fast-search budget |
| [`command-contracts.yaml`](.claude/skills/card-shared/command-contracts.yaml) | Required sections and YAML schema per command |
| [`card-identity-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/card-identity-rules.md) | Card-name resolution and variant disambiguation |
| [`confidence-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/confidence-rules.md) | `confirmed` / `unconfirmed` / `conflicting` definitions |
| [`recency-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/recency-rules.md) | 3-month news window rules |
| [`normalization-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/normalization-rules.md) | Shared formatting conventions |

---

## Validate Fixtures

```bash
./tests/run_all.sh
```

Runs 12 fixture validations + composition check + cross-fixture consistency check. See [`tests/`](tests/) for golden, ambiguous, conflict, missing, and recency fixture sets.

## Notes

- Major US card brands (Amex, Bank of America, Barclays, Bilt, Capital One, Chase, Citi, Discover, Robinhood, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo) — including hotel and airline co-branded cards
- `/card-news` is intentionally independent from `/card-full` — news is time-windowed and conceptually separate
- YAML output contracts are internal only and never appear in user-facing output
- See [`sample-outputs.md`](sample-outputs.md) for 10 real example outputs across all 8 commands
