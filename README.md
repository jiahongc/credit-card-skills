## How It Works

- **Issuer-first**: always fetches the card's official product page before secondary sources
- **Fast**: targets a ~2-minute research budget per command
- **Compact**: emoji section headings, numbered lists, no prose padding
- **Honest**: unresolved fields are flagged in confidence notes, never invented
- **15 approved sources**: mainstream finance + points-and-miles specialists (see [`source-policy.yaml`](.claude/skills/card-shared/source-policy.yaml))

---

## Compatibility

Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard — one `SKILL.md` format, works across agents.

| Agent | Skill path |
|-------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| OpenAI Codex | `.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/` |
| Others | see [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) |

---

## Shared Layer

All commands share a single research policy and output contracts:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`source-policy.yaml`](.claude/skills/card-shared/source-policy.yaml) | Approved sources, issuer domains, fast-search budget |
| [`command-contracts.yaml`](.claude/skills/card-shared/command-contracts.yaml) | Required sections and YAML schema per command |
| [`card-identity-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/card-identity-rules.md) | Card-name resolution and variant disambiguation |
| [`confidence-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/confidence-rules.md) | `confirmed` / `unconfirmed` / `conflicting` definitions |
| [`recency-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/recency-rules.md) | 3-month news window rules |
| [`normalization-rules.md`](.claude/skills/card-shared/normalization-rules.md) | Shared formatting conventions |

---

## Validate Fixtures

```bash
./tests/run_all.sh
```

Runs 12 fixture validations + composition check + cross-fixture consistency check. See [`tests/`](tests/) for golden, ambiguous, conflict, missing, and recency fixture sets.

---

## Notes

- Major US issuers only (Amex, Chase, Capital One, Citi, Bank of America, Discover, Wells Fargo)
- `/card-news` is intentionally independent from `/card-full` — news is time-windowed and conceptually separate
- YAML output contracts are internal only and never appear in user-facing output
- See [`sample-outputs.md`](sample-outputs.md) for 10 real example outputs across all 8 commands
