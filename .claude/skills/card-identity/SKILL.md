# Card Identity

## Purpose

Centralized card-name resolution used by all commands in the card suite. Every user-facing command should call this logic as step 1 before doing any research.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Normalize input** — strip extra whitespace, fix common abbreviations (e.g., "CSP" → "Chase Sapphire Preferred", "Amex" → "American Express").
2. **Parse components** — extract issuer, card family, and card variant separately when possible.
3. **Check issuer scope** — verify the issuer is in the approved list from [../card-shared/source-policy.yaml](../card-shared/source-policy.yaml). If not, return a short failure: "This card is not from a supported issuer."
4. **Resolve variant** — if the input maps to exactly one variant, proceed with confident match. If multiple variants are plausible, follow the ambiguity rules below.

## Ambiguity Handling

- If the input maps to 2+ plausible variants (e.g., "Chase Sapphire" → Preferred or Reserve):
  - Return a **numbered choice list** and stop. Do not guess.
  - Format: one card per line with issuer, family, variant.
- If no plausible match exists:
  - Return a short failure: "Could not match a card. Try including the full card name with issuer."

## Confident Match Output

When the match is confident, the calling command should:
- **Omit** the `## Card Identity` section from user-facing output.
- Populate the card identity YAML keys (`card_name`, `issuer`, `network`, `card_family`, `card_variant`) in the internal YAML block.

## Weak / Unconfirmed Match Output

When the match is the best-supported variant but not certain:
- **Show** the `## ⚠️ Card Identity` section in user-facing output with the matched variant and a note about competing matches.
- Set `status: unconfirmed` on the relevant summary field.
- List competing variants in `confidence_notes`.
