# Card News

## Goal

Return the last-3-month news view of one exact card variant in compact format.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the card using [../card-identity/SKILL.md](../card-identity/SKILL.md). If ambiguous, return a numbered choice list and stop.
2. Apply the 3-month lookback and inclusion rules from [../card-shared/recency-rules.md](../card-shared/recency-rules.md).
3. Follow the fast-search policy in [../card-shared/source-policy.yaml](../card-shared/source-policy.yaml): issuer pages first, then a small recent-news scan across up to 4 approved secondary sources.
4. Follow [../card-shared/confidence-rules.md](../card-shared/confidence-rules.md).
5. Return compact markdown using the `card-news` contract in [../card-shared/command-contracts.yaml](../card-shared/command-contracts.yaml).
6. YAML is internal only — do not include it in user-facing output.
7. Do not show inline links, a sources footer, or a "Why It Matters" section.

## Required Sections

- `## 📅 News Window`
- `## 📰 Recent Updates`
- `## 📝 Summary`
- `## 📋 Confidence Notes`

Omit `## Card Identity` when the match is confident. Use a numbered list for recent updates with a short summary line per item.
