# Card Credits

## Goal

Return the credits view of one exact card variant in compact format.

## Search Strategy: knowledge-first

Use training knowledge plus one issuer page fetch. Do NOT search secondary sources. Do NOT spawn a subagent — answer directly.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the card using [../card-identity/SKILL.md](../card-identity/SKILL.md). If ambiguous, return a numbered choice list and stop.
2. Run one Brave Search API call scoped to the issuer domain (see `search_method` in [../card-shared/source-policy.yaml](../card-shared/source-policy.yaml)):
   ```
   curl -sS "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=CARD+NAME+credits+benefits+site:ISSUER_DOMAIN&count=5" -H "X-Subscription-Token: $BRAVE_API_KEY"
   ```
   If `$BRAVE_API_KEY` is not set, fall back to WebSearch.
3. Combine the search snippets with training knowledge to fill all required sections. Do not search secondary sources.
4. Follow [../card-shared/confidence-rules.md](../card-shared/confidence-rules.md). Flag any detail that may have changed since training data.
5. Return compact markdown using the `card-credits` contract in [../card-shared/command-contracts.yaml](../card-shared/command-contracts.yaml).
6. YAML is internal only — do not include it in user-facing output.
7. Do not show inline links, a sources footer, or a "Why It Matters" section.

## Required Sections

- `## 💳 Credits Overview`
- `## 🏷️ Credit Details`
- `## 📏 Usage Rules`
- `## 📋 Confidence Notes`

Omit `## Card Identity` when the match is confident. Use a numbered list for credits with amount, cadence, trigger, and restriction in one compact line per item.
