# Card Profile Recommend

Return a graded portfolio audit plus opinionated new-card recommendations with signup bonus strategy, churning paths, and issuer rule checks.

## When To Use

When the user wants to know which cards to keep, drop, or add next. Trigger phrases: "card-profile-recommend", "recommend cards", "what cards should I add", "credit card recommendations", "optimize my wallet", "what card should I get next", "improve my card lineup".

## Input Format

The user provides a comma-separated list of cards they currently hold:
- `card-profile-recommend Chase Sapphire Preferred, Amex Gold, Citi Double Cash`

Optional: opening dates per card (inline or separate list):
- `card-profile-recommend CSP (Jan 2024), Amex Gold (Mar 2023), Double Cash (2021)`

When opening dates are provided, calculate exact 5/24 count and factor into grading decisions.

## Workflow

1. **Parse card list** from comma-separated input.
2. **Resolve each card** — normalize and match to exact variants. If any card is ambiguous, return a numbered choice list for that card and stop.
3. **Search** — run one Brave Search API call per card plus any needed gap-category searches, but do not burst them blindly.
4. **Fetch pages** — for each card, fetch the top issuer URL + 1 secondary (prefer thepointsguy.com). For new-card candidates, fetch up to 2 secondary pages.
5. **Pace any follow-up searches** — if more Brave searches are needed, serialize them with short waits rather than firing them all at once.
6. **Collect** — for each card: annual fee, statement credits (with conditions), earning categories with rates, welcome offer status, notable benefits.
6. **Portfolio economics** — compute total gross fees, total claimable credits, net annual cost. Per-card net cost.
7. **Grade each card** — MVP / Keep / Consider Dropping per grading criteria below.
8. **Point valuations** — determine effective cpp for each currency using TPG valuations + transfer-access rule.
9. **Earning map** — best card per category with effective value (rate × cpp).
10. **Identify gaps** — categories earning below 2x / 2%.
11. **Recommend 2–3 new personal cards** — fill gaps, add ecosystems, maximize SUB windows, include churning strategy.
12. **Build application sequence** — ordered by priority with timing notes.
13. **Confidence** — flag uncertain claims.

## Step 1: Card Identity Resolution

### Common Abbreviations

| Input | Resolved |
|---|---|
| CSP | Chase Sapphire Preferred |
| CSR | Chase Sapphire Reserve |
| CFU | Chase Freedom Unlimited |
| CFF | Chase Freedom Flex |
| CIP | Chase Ink Business Preferred |
| CIC | Chase Ink Business Cash |
| CIU | Chase Ink Business Unlimited |
| Amex Gold | American Express Gold Card |
| Amex Plat | American Express Platinum Card |
| Venture X | Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card |
| Double Cash | Citi Double Cash Card |
| Custom Cash | Citi Custom Cash Card |
| Bilt | Bilt Blue / Obsidian / Palladium (ambiguous — ask) |
| Robinhood | Robinhood Gold Card / Cash Card (ambiguous — ask) |

### Supported Issuers

American Express, Bank of America, Barclays, Bilt, Capital One, Chase, Citi, Discover, Robinhood, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo.

## Step 2: Search

For each card, run one Brave Search API call:

```bash
curl -sS "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=CARD+NAME+benefits+credits+annual+fee&count=10" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: $BRAVE_API_KEY"
```

Do not assume Brave tolerates a large burst of parallel searches.

### Search Budget Rule

Brave may rate-limit after only a few closely spaced requests. Treat search as scarce and paced.

- Start with the most important cards first.
- Fetch issuer and approved secondary pages before deciding whether more searches are needed.
- When multiple searches are required, serialize them in small batches or add short waits of about **2 to 5 seconds** between bursts.
- If Brave returns **429**, wait about **8 to 15 seconds** and retry once for the still-missing search.
- If it still fails, continue with the best evidence already gathered and note the limitation in `## 🔍 Confidence Notes`.

Additionally, search for new-card candidates targeting gap categories.

### Fetch Pages

For each card, fetch the top issuer URL + 1 secondary:

```bash
curl -sS -L "URL" | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | tr -s '\n' | head -200
```

### Issuer Domains (for classifying results)

| Issuer | Domain |
|---|---|
| American Express | americanexpress.com |
| Bank of America | bankofamerica.com |
| Barclays | cards.barclaycardus.com |
| Bilt | bfrrewards.com |
| Capital One | capitalone.com |
| Chase | chase.com |
| Citi | citi.com |
| Discover | discover.com |
| Robinhood | robinhood.com |
| U.S. Bank | usbank.com |
| Wells Fargo | wellsfargo.com |

## Grading Criteria

### MVP
- Net cost ≤ $50, OR unique 3x+ earn category, OR unique high-value benefit (lounge, hotel status, primary travel insurance)
- Best rate in at least one major spend category
- Not rendered redundant by another card in wallet

### Keep
- Partially justifying benefit or earn rate
- Long credit history
- Transferable points diversification
- Under 12 months old

### Consider Dropping
- Fees exceed claimable credits with no unique benefit
- All categories duplicated at equal or better rate
- No-fee downgrade path exists
- **Never** grade Consider Dropping if the card is the sole source of a transferable-points program

### Unused Card Check
After building the earning map, flag any card that does not appear as "Best Card" in any category and has an annual fee.

## Point Valuation: Transfer-Access Rule

A currency is only worth full TPG value if the wallet has a card that unlocks transfers. Without one, value is 1.0¢ (cash back).

| Currency | Transfer-enabling cards | Full value |
|---|---|---|
| Chase UR | Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire Reserve | ~2.0¢ |
| Amex MR | Gold, Platinum, Green | ~2.0¢ |
| Capital One Miles | Venture X, Venture | ~1.8¢ |
| Citi TYP | Strata Premier, Strata Elite (NOT Custom Cash/Double Cash alone) | ~1.7¢ |
| Bilt Points | Any Bilt card | ~1.8¢ |
| World of Hyatt | Chase Hyatt card | ~1.8¢ |
| Marriott Bonvoy | Any Marriott co-brand | ~0.7¢ |
| Cash back | Any | 1.0¢ |

## Recommendation Logic

Select 2–3 new **personal** cards only. Never recommend business cards. Priority order:
1. Fill highest-value spend gap
2. Add new transferable-points ecosystem
3. Maximize signup bonus window (Chase-first if 5/24 allows)
4. Avoid worsening overlap
5. Prioritize elevated offers
6. Diversify issuers
7. Churning value — favor cards with SUB ≥ 5x annual fee, no-fee downgrade paths, and reasonable bonus cooldown windows. Note churn path explicitly.
